            <p id="aboutMeText">Rising from the ashes of La Porte, TX, this human moved to Austin in '96 to escape the sinkhole of chemical-laden ignorance
                and work towards a healthier perspective on the world.  After educating myself at The University of Texas, Austin Community College, and finally getting
                my Bachelor of Science in Sound Recording Technology, I began editing video at the Austin Music Network.  Shortly after they lost their funding I made
                my way to the tech-giant Apple and rose to a position of iCloud Site Support Engineering.  The journey was 14 years long and I am now branching off
                from the support side of tech to the development side by attending this boot camp.  Once done, I have a feeling my heart will be in front end design, 
                though after my failure this week to firmly grasp CSS positioning, perhaps I might not.
